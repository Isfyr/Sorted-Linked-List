# Sorted-Linked-List
In this lab, you'll write a classic container class: a linked list.

This particular linked list stores its items in sorted order. The first item in the list is less than or equal to all the other items, and the last item is greater than or equal to all the other items. The user doesn't get (or need) to specify an index when adding items to the list; the list class should put the new item in the correct place automatically.

Since Python is a dynamically typed language, the list can store any value that supports the standard comparison operators (<, ==, etc.). The user (and the autograder) will always use a single type of value per list, so you won't have to compare two values of different types.
